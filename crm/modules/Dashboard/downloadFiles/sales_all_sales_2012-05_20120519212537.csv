Sale of 2kW system. Warned them their large trees will definitely impact production of solar, but some are deciduous so that  helps the winter sun issue somewhat, and positioning on roof is vital...panels to face west on southern end of western roof area...Smart Meter due to be installed in next 2 weeks so installatin asap would be good before this happens.
