Fred is pretty astute and observant. He challenged me on the statement on the top of page 17 of the Simax booklet, where it says the ""warranty is only applicable to customers who have purchased the PV Modules directly from SImax."" How do you reassure customers who read that? He showed me another quote that guarantee 42c/kW FIT over a number of years, and gives figures of a saving of over a $1000/year on a 3kW system. They were much cheaper than us, although he was unsure. He is getting more quotes and doing more research before deciding.

13/2/12 Yasa has done his figures and simply cannot afford it...he is the sole breadwinner and cannot see how they can make ends meet, even considering Certegy. He has my number if he discovers a money tree. Electricity bill $200 for quarter for the 4 of them, so they are  very frugal in their power usuage.
","Said has to be a quick consultation. Asked about brand & quality of panels. Had received a quote of $8000 from another company & was no good as he's willing to pay around $3000 only."

I need to do measuring of roof to see if all panels can go on north facing roof area or split on west side as well.  3kW system with 250wattage covers quarterly bill. Permission given from Vishal to discount 10% to bring toal to $5400. No Smart meter.

Spoke with George and he's going to get the roof man in to see if it needs painting prior to getting the panels mounted. He's still needing me to assure him that the panels from China are as good as the German made ones...he seems reassured (again!) today. I'm to phone him Friday week. Keen to go with the 3.5kW system of 250wattage requiring 10 panels on north facing roof and 4 on western side. Vishal has given permission for 10% discount.

George and Katia at doctor's...will phone back later today.

George is going around to his daughter's to do internet research on solar...read out offers in the Dandenon Leader newspaper with 3kW 16 panel German panels for $5999 and $4999for Chinese ones. German ones polycrystalline so I explained mono were superior and most suitable for Oz climate...he still has an issue thinking goods from China equal poor quality. I think he wants to give me the sale though and said that maybe I will get two sales (him and his daughter) after they have done more research.
,2012-03-20 14:07:58
George has decided that at his age and stage it's too much of an investment, but if he changes his mind, he'll phone ME (and not any other company!)

Not sure why there's a problem here as notes from client indicate that any day and anytime after the 12th March is fine, as his mother is always home??
,2012-03-15 10:27:01
Called the customer yesterday and today - he is busy and his wife passed on the message she said that he will get back to us when he is free regarding the new installation time. 
,2012-03-16 09:01:01
Tried to call the customer over the last few days and the wife was very rude- she basically told me to stop calling and she has passed on the message of installation and to call me back to her husband. Both installer and myself have not been able to get a hold of the customer- and I can't book things in with his wife because she said that i have to speak with her husband.

However, he's speaking with other company and wants me to phone him next week...I wrote down questions he has to ask them so I know we're up against.the same thing...and cautioned him about the viability of the company and as to whether he's checked them out thoroughly etc Offered him 10% discount if he came with us. Stayed for tea and nibbles and chatted about philosophy for extra 30mins! He said he' like to give me the business but needs to check out other company again which is offering what he thinks is the same for much less.

This customer is refrred by existing customer, who already installed simax panel with macsolar invertor, he already know about the panels brands, but he selected diffrent invertor, because he want to go with Big System, on the time of booking i showed him both rates, macsolar &amp; SMA, as we dont have 6.0KW invertor in macsolar, my mistake was on his quote paper i have mentioned SMA (For Panels) not for invertor, but i realised my mistake, i need to mentioned SMA invertor instead of Panels Brands, This customer know about that, but he didnt say anything, but on installation time, he said he wants to go with German panels, which we dont have, the final decision he wants more discount, thats what he is looking ad he got.

Customer phoned Certegy said that he has a faulty inverter- Vishal spoke to Certegy and will chat with John about this. Apprantly it was incorrectly installed. Daniel (according to Vishal) is aware of the situation and the three need to have a discussion. 
,2012-03-21 13:49:49
Daniel Marriott will go to fix the problem on Thursday, 22 March 2012. either change the inverter or fix the installation, the two inverter is too close to each other, that may be the cause of the problem, need a minimum distance of 30cm by the customer searching on website.
,2012-03-22 08:50:35
After receving Vishal's email I phoned the customer's retailer- they wouldn't give me any information in relation to the documents I sent through earlier. After looking through the documents everything seems to be okay so Vishal needs to call the customer to communicate with him about calling his retailer directly so they can give us feedback on what needs to be redone and sent through. 
,2012-03-22 13:30:48
Spoke with Daniel and he confirmed that at the moment everything is operational- all working with the system. There was an error that was showing up that was only showing once per week so there can be no way to actually check that- he said that if the error comes up again then we will just need to arrange for a replacement inverter.
