Jenny, how about the finance option. What was her response on the finance option?  $0 deposit?  We can also consolidate her renovation expense with solar panels and get her the finance. By the time she has money for solar, rebates will reduce by $700 - $800 on 1.5KW and higher on bigger systems. Now even with 17% interest it is worthwhile for them mainly if they look at 2 year repayments

Hello John and Anna,

As per our conversation, I have tabled below various sized systems, their impact on your av quarterly bill and prices (which are
AFTER the govt rebates) and prices, giving both German and Chinese inverter options. I have based the calculations on an average
quarterly bill of $350 of which $70 ish is the supply/service charge, hence a rounded figure of $280 allowing for this:

System size with 250 watt panels 	 Average quarterly bill -excluding $60-70 supply charge 	Approx reduced bill with solar 	Discount Price with German inverter -ends 26 May 	Discount price with Chinese inverter -ends  26 May
1.5kW   6 panels 	$280 	$126 	$1,899 	$1,899
2 kW     8 	$280 	$63 	$2,999 	$2,699
2.5        10 	$280 	$0 	$4,999 	$4,299
3kW     12 	$280 	$63 credit 	$5,999 	$4,999
Above calculations based on Feed in Tariff rate of 33cents per kWh with AGL.

Please review the above in accordance with your budget and how much you wish to reduce your
current electricity bill. Also take a look at our website, and I'll wait to hear back from you on Saturday/Sunday if you'd like me to prioritise you
and save you $900!

Enjoy your trip away meanwhile.


Regards
Jenny

Switchboard photos and roof plan emailed to Tommy...but please note:
NB The attached roof panel plan has the 8 panels along the ridge of the north facing roof area, but if the installer thinks the shading on the panels will be less by placing one row of 4 at the east ridge (roadside end of roof) and another row immediately below, then so be it.
This customer has no circuit breaker/safety switch and I didn't want to risk losing the sale by mentioning this at the time, so this needs to be handled also. Let me know if you'd like me to phone her about this, otherwise I'll assume the installer will do this when he phones to make a time for installation.

Mittel is a very tough retired Italian woman who is considering solar but adamant that when she spoke to the person from our company re an appt, they said she could get a 12 panel system for $2000 and agreed that she wouldn't have to pay a deposit! She said she's been ripped off too many times and doesn't trust companies, so no deposit if she proceeds and she will pay cash upon installation and we can trust her! I said that she could trust me to ensure all would proceed well...will get back to her after she's spoken with her live-in adult grandchild.

Otherwise JB to give client option of split array and more cost, or all panels on west with reduced production.

Had long appointment last Sat 19th May with Rita and Robert...they have some tricky roof and shading issues, plus two storey....needed time to work out if it was worth it.

Rita phoned back today to say that they weren't proceeding as although our prices were very competitive and we gave the most comprehensive info, they are only likely to be in that house for another 7 years (as Robert now 71yrs and property large and demanding), so factoring in the pay off time and virtually no solar gain due to shading in winter, and part of spring and autumn they don't choose to spend their money this way.

Ron and Pauline are pensioners and a 1.5kW system would be the most they can manage...they hadn't even considered solar prior to ph call from call centre. Bill is with TRU $240/quarter, so usage about $180  and he's not sure if they can stretch to $1899 but will speak with Pauline when she's home. He knows NZ and says to tell my boss  I should have Waitangi Day off with pay, in February!! Happy for me to fax through info today and JB to phone on Monday.

System size with 250 watt panels 	 Average quarterly bill -excluding $60-70 supply charge 	Approx reduced bill with solar 	Discount Price with German inverter -ends 20 May 	Discount price with Chinese inverter -ends  20 May

3.5kW  14 	$280 	$105 credit 	$6,999 	$5,999
Above calculations based on Feed in Tariff rate of 31cents per kWh with TRU.
NB Above prices are AFTER the govt rebates which are being slashed by 33% for any systems installed after 30 June 2012.
Extra charges:  $396 for flat roof fee for a 3.5kW system and $50 less as system size goes down...this is something we may
need to do at your property John (if you proceed) as you have multiple angular small sections of roof on your home, so the carport
may need to be considered an option for panel placement.

Daniel went out with his boys today to inspect the customers roof and they said that it can’t be done because of the tiles that he has. They said that he has thin concrete tiles and when they tried to put a tile bracket underneath it the tile stuck up so it would mean if they were to proceed with the installation there would be leaks everywhere. 

Also- he is in need of a switchboard upgrade and Daniel said that if he wants a quote they are available for that.

Dear Jade,

Information regarding the above customer.

Appointment Date 07/05/2012, Gave him 5 Brouchers, 4 for Inverters (MacSolar, Solar Power, Effekta,SMA) and 1 for Simax.
Explained him in clear that panels from china, but have option for inverters.
Gave him quote in both (German Inverter, Chines Inverter), He told me, he want to check with other companies then he'll call back if he want to proceed.

Called him back by 14/05/2012, and he said yes i want to proceed with your company, because your price is better. Went to his property, showed him again both price chart, With German Inverter, With Chines Inverter, then he said he want to go with german effekta, booked his system, and gave his copy to him for records, while completed the paper work, showed him again 10Panels Simax with Effekta Inverter, Customer read then signed.

Now he got offer from Green Teach Solar, 3Kw System in $4700, so that's why he is making excuse and giving me threads, but i told him very clear, ""We'll not refund any money, if u wish to cancel"" And i told him if you want to see me in court, i am happy to see u in court as well, because there is not my fault, he checked everything then he made his decision.

Thanks &amp; regards

Feedback call- re-iterated above response.

Mr Halkic is buying a gas hot water system first, then will consider solar power, subject to finance
,2012-05-19 23:41:26
Comments contradict the SALE PROGRESS. If they want hot water before the solar, the processing for solar can commence which would include processing the finance application, stock alllocation. So process need to start now PLUS since they low on cash flow, we might combine his hot water and solar on one loan. So they will not be out of pocket by few thousand for hot water.
,2012-05-21 19:02:51
Your guess is wrong. Mr Halkic told me they are getting Gas hot water first, then with cash left over will get solar if possible. They need gas hot water first because they have pressure problem with the electric hot water. Cash is tight in the family.
,2012-05-22 20:17:59
Spoke to Mr Halkic, they are getting gas hot water, solar will have to wait

This one caught me off guard , main house with guest house/bed and breakfast ;also possibly additional guest cottage to be built. 
Quoted $10,000 for a 5KW and $19,000 for a 10KW system , she wanted to know if we had 10KW+ inverters sand may possibly run power for a 3rd cottage from the one meter ..? Eg: intially 10KW system with 15KW/20KW inverter from one meter, can this be done or seperate inverters..? Also they have 3phase power for fountain at front of property any additional costs there..?
Installers would need to use scissor lift as roof is steep but plenty of room , possibly split array needed for 10KW system, one meter runs both houses on the property..she is not rushing to beat the rebate just considering the solar option..
,2012-06-01 17:12:38
Ross to advise the customer extra $500 for scissor lift and $330 for split array
,2012-06-02 19:01:33
Will contact customer during the week.

I spoke with her today and she is not looking at solar for another 12 months until she builds a new cottage for her property.

This one is looking promising , he has 3 phase power(the 2nd one in two days!) , if we can provide an inverter than can handle 3 phase power the deal is almost done! ; 2-3KW system quoted..

Feedback call- No issues
,2012-06-02 13:26:26
Ross, as discussed before, we install the inverter to one of the phases. This approach is better for customer because we can install the inverter to the phase with the least amount of power consumption. Please provide the update along with the prices offered, reaction of the customer and whether finance was offered.
,2012-06-02 19:06:16
Explained everything to him , Not interested ! wanted inverter that could handle 3 phase power evenly, very  important to him. All customers i meet are offered the finance
,2012-06-06 20:46:18
Called the customer again , i proposed two 1.52KW systems to cover two of the least used phases so this would amount to roughly the same spend as a 3.04KW system..He asked me to e-mail him this quote which i will do.

Old couple. Quarterly bill about $480. Quoted them on 3KW effekta. They might need repayments. They also mentioned that even though the neighbour which is on west side have double storey but the walls are unusually 12 m apart. So they may not get the shadow on the roof and they didn't know for sure.

bill was about $300 per quarter as average. She wanted a quote on 2KW as well as 5KW. She understands that 2KW may not even make her bill zero. She has been looking into solar system and was aware of how it all works. Quoted $9500 for 5KW and $3500 for 2KW with 3KW inverter. Her husband will be back in melbourne on 23rd and they are looking to buy the system in first week of June
