Now that I'm clear about loan amount I have made appt with Vasanth for Sat 10.30am to do finance on-line. Order form sent in today, and Vasanth to do Bpay transaction now that he's received the deposit figure.
,2012-05-05 11:49:51
Successful online application completed with client. Vasanth to send in high resolution switchboard photo this weekend, as the one I took is too small for Du to read, based on previous 3.
,2012-05-07 11:41:35
switch board photos received, all good, not upgrade needed, just waiting for the deposit to come in and finance approved to organise the installation
,2012-05-07 14:40:05
Vasanth has copied me in on an email to Mabel at finance company with payslips attached.

Finally got hold of Andrew -very busy about to move family out of house for 6 weeks while new flooring put in. Explained about car accident so had appt over phone and he's looking at a 3.5 or 4kw system to cover av bill of $400 quarterly. Finance will be required, and he wants to know if the cabling can be done discreetly as all his wiring is underground. Worked out panels could fit on upper and lower north orientated roof areas. Quoted double storey and split array fees also. Email him when finance available although he may be able to organise something himself.

Spoke with Andrew who said system is installed but that installer placed it in a very hot spot in summer, and not undercover/sheltered as I had said and more importantly, as the manual recommends. Andrew is concerned about this and suggested that perhaps we could put a meter box around it (at our expense) to protect as written in the documentation. JB to speak to Vishal.
,2012-04-23 12:28:40
Inverter- is put in the wrong space- because it will get too hot. says that it is right in the sun- and it willl exceed 40 degrees in summer. 
,2012-04-23 12:41:27
Have emailed the installer with this comment and awaiting his response. 
Have passed on the credit card details to Jenny for processing,

Spoke with wife Maria and they have huge bills of $750 average. Origin offer interest free for 24mths, but when I talked prices at the end, she said it's all too much. Also concerned about bills for tenants that she pays for -as it's on a combined meter, however she ended up just throwing the towel in on the whole idea. I phoned back today and offered to do another consult when husband was free and less busy, and apologised for having to interrupt consult to take critical callback I was waiting for.

Phoned John from accident scene yesterday to apologise that I would not be able to continue my drive due to crash, but would speak with him today. When I phoned today he sounded very 'put out' and said he wasn't interested in solar at all. I asked what had captured his interest in accepting the appointment and he just answered that he was never really interested, even when I likened it to a mortgage, from an investment point of view, versus 'renting' and getting nothing back.

Myron  (South African) has two storey house that could fit 10 panels on northern roof area and reduce his $600 per quarter bill to $368. We looked at 3.5 and 4.5kW systems also but his cashflow is limited and he'd prefer to go with smaller system . Asked about finance options and I suggested he look at a loan from the bank, but he thinks he'd rather just stick with what he can manage -the 2.5kW system. He'll get back to me but ok about me phoning in a week.

Had 30min phone consultation with Kamal (pronounced Camel -and she's a woman not MR!) and have appt on Monday to sign her up for a 3kW Effekta system for $6900 (versus base price of $6699). We were up against AGL who quoted her 12 panel 3kW system for $8K. However...at the end of the conversation she said that they offered her the option of only paying a deposit of $319 and then fortnightly repayments of $150 over 2 years. I've told her we require $690 deposit (that's ok) and then will talk to you about the balance...she can't get a loan from the bank as already has a mortgage etc.

Stella phoned me to check that our installers really were professional as she'd had a strange call to check the time for installation: the female calling asked her if she spoke Chinese (which Stella thought was very odd -she has a Greek accent)? I reassured her that the installer would not be that girl (!) and that all would be well...we had a bit of a laugh about it, and she's going to phone me back to brag about her beautiful panels when they're up on her roof!
