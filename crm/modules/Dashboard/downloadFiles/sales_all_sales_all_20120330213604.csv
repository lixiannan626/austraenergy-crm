Fred is pretty astute and observant. He challenged me on the statement on the top of page 17 of the Simax booklet, where it says the ""warranty is only applicable to customers who have purchased the PV Modules directly from SImax."" How do you reassure customers who read that? He showed me another quote that guarantee 42c/kW FIT over a number of years, and gives figures of a saving of over a $1000/year on a 3kW system. They were much cheaper than us, although he was unsure. He is getting more quotes and doing more research before deciding.

,2012-02-06 20:51:16
6/2/12 Gave Jan (Yano) formula and worked out annual solar output for a 2.28system Now wants me to find out i1. f it's necessary to have a biodirectional meter as well as a smart meter...(his friend says he has solar with neither of these and just watches the meter run backwards when solar is working??  2. How can I find out if the shading of trees is going to effect his solar output -Google Earth function -thought I saw it one day and now can't see it, 3. what is the best angle of the sun for maximising the solar output...what degree is best?
,2012-02-09 20:03:41

17/2/12 Spoke with Yano...many more questions re model of panels and inverter and re shading effects on panels i.e. if 2 panels shaded by neighbour's tree, does this effect other panels and by how much? Getting back to him at 4pm on Monday20th, as he's not around for rest of today and requested Monday.
,2012-02-20 18:33:09
20-2-12 Long talk with Yano -said that even with issue of winter shading bet 10-12noon I felt he would still be further in front with solar than staying with electricity only! JB to do more roof measurements and see if upper north facing roof area necessary in addition to western roof (he ahs cost concerns about the extra $500 for split array AND 2nd storey instalation. He's to ph me back on Wed or Thurs morning, as I said I could come and do paperwork on Thurs afternoon and keep that free for him.
,2012-03-02 18:27:04
1/3/12 Emailed Yano the proposed panel plan options and he now wants to wait a month to see how the council trees on the nature strip affect the shading onto his roof. I suggested a 3am tree trimming project?? I'll speak to Vishal to see if we can work out the shading affect withoug having to charge him $150 for an installer's assessment? He definitely wants to have solar but doesn't want it underperforming due to shading!! I said I'll get back to him after speaking with Vishal.
,2012-03-08 13:41:14
Left my ph number thru msge service...suggesting he pay $150 for installer to assess tree shading issue and this amount can be deducted from purchase amount (Vishal's permission).
,2012-03-08 19:01:35
Jan not so keen about installer idea yet but will now approach Knox council re trimming tree due to its negative impact on solar panels.

Yolande has put down a deposit  with a 3rd quoting company (the fact that she signed on Fri 9th March but we couldn't give her details for internet banking transfer of deposit until Monday afternoon probably didn't help us retain this sale) The solar company/ her cousin's friend, is upgrading her switchboard for $750 this Saturday 17th March. Vishal checking with Du re switchboard and pricing...but think the sale has been lost. Now have reference numbers for internet banking so this situation shouldn't occur in the future.

Address was actually 11 Victoria Ridge, Upper FG. Issue with trees surrounding property casting shade onto roof...ok for summer but winter questionable. They are going to monitor the sun on the north facing roof over the next week and I will look at my notes on the winter sun angle and see if they'll gain any value in winter?? Husband's ok about getting 6mths value per annum out of the system even if the shading does prohibit solar power for the most of winter.

Low pitched roof of 23 degrees -do we have mountings that raise the panels on low pitched roofs, or only for flat roofs?

@Jenny- 23 degrees is optimal for the panels. It's when it is below 15 degrees or above 30 degrees that there may be a loss of efficiency.

,2012-03-05 19:40:11

This customer is refrred by existing customer, who already installed simax panel with macsolar invertor, he already know about the panels brands, but he selected diffrent invertor, because he want to go with Big System, on the time of booking i showed him both rates, macsolar &amp; SMA, as we dont have 6.0KW invertor in macsolar, my mistake was on his quote paper i have mentioned SMA (For Panels) not for invertor, but i realised my mistake, i need to mentioned SMA invertor instead of Panels Brands, This customer know about that, but he didnt say anything, but on installation time, he said he wants to go with German panels, which we dont have, the final decision he wants more discount, thats what he is looking ad he got.

They are both 3.3 metres high. That would mean 2 rows on each side? Can this be done. If so how many Splits can 1 Inverter take? I have quoted on a 3.5kW system for $8600.

Customer paid the deposit for the system but informed the sales consultant that she can't afford to pay the balance. The sales consultant is Peter S- he has tried to get a hold of her but she has been unreachable for quite some time. When I phoned her at the start of the year to book the installation she said that she can't afford to pay the balance and we need to contact her after May but before June because the feed in tarrifs will change. 
,2012-02-14 12:01:16
Contact this customer after 2 months- 14th April.

Customer phoned Certegy said that he has a faulty inverter- Vishal spoke to Certegy and will chat with John about this. Apprantly it was incorrectly installed. Daniel (according to Vishal) is aware of the situation and the three need to have a discussion. 
,2012-03-21 13:49:49
Daniel Marriott will go to fix the problem on Thursday, 22 March 2012. either change the inverter or fix the installation, the two inverter is too close to each other, that may be the cause of the problem, need a minimum distance of 30cm by the customer searching on website.
,2012-03-22 08:50:35
After receving Vishal's email I phoned the customer's retailer- they wouldn't give me any information in relation to the documents I sent through earlier. After looking through the documents everything seems to be okay so Vishal needs to call the customer to communicate with him about calling his retailer directly so they can give us feedback on what needs to be redone and sent through. 
,2012-03-22 13:30:48
Spoke with Daniel and he confirmed that at the moment everything is operational- all working with the system. There was an error that was showing up that was only showing once per week so there can be no way to actually check that- he said that if the error comes up again then we will just need to arrange for a replacement inverter.
