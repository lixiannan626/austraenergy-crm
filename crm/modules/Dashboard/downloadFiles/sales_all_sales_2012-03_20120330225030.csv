I visited Terry today. He was angry because he had told the call centre operator that he did NOT want a rep to come to see him. He did not like the very poor english used by the operator, because he could not understand two thirds of what they said. He claimed to be very clear about his assertion that he did not want an appointment. He was not interested in getting solar panels on his roof. This was not a qualified lead.

We've suggested he pay $150 to have an installer come out and assess but he is loathe to pay this and lose $150. I said we'd look at the measurements again and get back to him if we thought there was any chance of success.

Started signing up in order book and then Louis freaked out with potential cost of having to get circuit breaker as well. Spoke with Vishal about this today and costs vary according to meter box set up etc so $750-$1000 not necessarily the case. Cost me the sale as they are retired and struggling already. Will give follow up call on Friday.

They are going to monitor the sun on the north facing roof over the next week and I will look at my notes on the winter sun angle and see if they'll gain any value in winter??

Mr Hesse wasnt expecting me, he was expecting a phone call. After a 5 minute discussion at the front gate I convinced him to let me in to discuss his options. He is keen to get a solar sytem probabely a 1.5 kw, but is unsure about the quality of his roof. So I wrote him up a quote.

Oh and one more thing, it was a very awkward appointment considering I had to sit on a bed to have the discussion.

Customer wanted to spend only $2000 for 1.90Kw System with 10 Panels of 190 Watt, I tried to explain her in so many ways, but she was saying, her husband budget is only $2000 not more then that, If we can do something under or $2000, She is happy to proceed with cash payment.

They are both 3.3 metres high. That would mean 2 rows on each side? Can this be done. If so how many Splits can 1 Inverter take? I have quoted on a 3.5kW system for $8600.
