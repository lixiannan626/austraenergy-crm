If customer wants the system need to make that clear- additional costs for the split due to the larger inverter."

Phoned back with a follow up call a few days later. Customer was no longer interested in purchasing the system- said he would call us back in 4-6 months if anything changed. Got the feeling he was just looking for a quote. 
","2.28KW system (quoted on old pricing structure) no additional extras."

James Gray was happy to go ahead with the sale based on our prices, however he was installing it on a home that had not been built yet. He needed to factor in additional costs such as connection to the pit on the boundary line etc. Have called and emailed back and forth - he stated when he has the electricity pit sorted","5kw system on old pricing- hasn't built the house yet, is keen but wants to know details of the boundary pit etc."

This customer wants a 10kW system. Customer says he will do the job in two parts- 5kW and then 5kW since he doesn't have enough capitol to do it all together. This was handled by Jade and passed onto John. 
","Wants a 10kw system- but have quoted him for a 5kw system on the old pricing structure. 
Looks to be both tiled and tin roof."
